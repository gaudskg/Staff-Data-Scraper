# Staff-Data-Scraper
This script is a web scraper that extracts staff information from a school's staff directory webpage. It uses the requests and lxml libraries to fetch and parse HTML pages, and the pandas library to store and manipulate the extracted data. The script can handle pagination, retries failed requests, and exports the extracted data to a CSV file.
